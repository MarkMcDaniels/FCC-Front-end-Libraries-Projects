# FCC-Front-end-Libraries-Projects
The 5 projects for FCC's front end library certification.


# Project 1 Random quote machine 10/26/18 

    Finished in one, and a half days. More trouble sorting out the Codepen environment to run react-redux.

    Built with react-redux, and sass.

# Project 2 Markdown Previewer 10/30/18

    Finsished project in two days. Had unseen characters in the codepens editor causing bugs that weren't defined. FCC's tester also had a bug that I found managing H2 raw text. Error was verified. 

    I keep running into more errors with the environments than with my actual coding.

    Built with React, and Sass

# Project 3 Drum kit 11/4/18

    Wrote the drum kit twice. I bifurcated the flow by click, and key events. It wasn't updating the display way I had hoped. If you flipped back and forth from clicking to keying, it would not render properely. To avoid this I built all my listeners in the mounting phase. This solved that issue. Learned a lot.

    Built with React, and Sass.
